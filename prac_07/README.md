# Practical 07 - Kivy

**Note**: This is a fairly long practical, so allocate more than the usual time for it.  
There are a lot of demos to learn and copy from in <https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos>.

If you're using your own computer, and you haven't already done so, please follow the setup instructions for installing
Kivy at:
<https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Software-Setup>

If you haven't already, **please save yourself time and make life easier**
by adding kv language syntax highlighting and auto-completion
(since PyCharm does not know about kv language by default):

- Download: <https://github.com/Zen-CODE/kivybits/blob/master/IDE/PyCharm_kv_completion.jar?raw=true>

- In PyCharm's main menu, click **Import Settings** or **File >
  Import**, depending on your version

- Select the .jar file you just downloaded and click OK in the dialog with file types.

- Restart PyCharm.

***Seriously***, it's worth the 1-2 minutes that this will take.  

# Walkthrough Example

**Download** the GitHub repository for our Kivy Examples:
[https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos](https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos)

You could use Git to clone it, which makes a complete copy, including the Git history, but since you don't have write
permissions on this repo you will not be able to push changes back to it. The easiest thing is just to use the GitHub
website to **Download ZIP**.

![GitHub Download ZIP option](../images/07image1.png)

1. The work that you do for this practical should be saved, committed and pushed to your Practicals repository in
   the `prac_07` folder. The simplest thing is to just **copy everything from the demos zip you just downloaded into
   your `prac_07` folder**. Then only commit the work you do. You don't need to upload all the other examples to GitHub,
   but you can if you really really want.

2. (Here's a very simple example)  
   Open and run the `hello_world.py` file.  
   You should see a plain black window with "HelloWorld" in the title.

3. (Here's an advanced example)  
   Open and run the `popup_demo.py` file (which uses
   `popup_demo.kv`) and run that to see how it works. You don't need to understand it all just yet, but try to get an
   overview of the structure, and look for the parts you do recognise.

## Modify Existing GUI Program

Open the `box_layout_demo.py` and `box_layout.kv` files and run the Python program. You should see three vertical
buttons.

Let's extend this program to make an app that lets the user enter and clear their name, and greets them when we push a
button. It will end up looking like this:

![BoxLayout Demo screenshot](../images/07image2.png)

1. Add a **label** below the third button with the **text** "Enter your name":

```
Button:
    text: 'three'
Label:
    text: 'Enter your name'
```

2. Set the new label's text colour to yellow, by adding the following property details "inside" the label:

       color: (1, 1, 0, 1)

3. Change the first button so it says "Clear" and the third button so it says "Greet".

4. Now to add a button handler, you need to edit both the py and kv files. Look at the 'id_demo' files for a good
   example of this...  
   Add a callback for the press event in the kv file, like:

       Button:
           text: 'Greet'
           on_press: app.handle_greet()

   This references a method in your main app class called
   `handle_greet()`.

5. Add the `handle_greet()` function in your .py file and put a `print('greet')`
   statement in that function.  
   Test it. If this works, and you see 'greet' in the console (not the Kivy window), then you know the connection
   between the button and this function works, so you can keep going...

6. The next step is to change the text of the label.  
   Add an id to the label, like:

       id: output_label

7. Now in your handle_greet function, change this label's text, like:

   ```python
   print("test")
   self.root.ids.output_label.text = "Hello "
   ```

8. Change button "two" to a text input field, like:

       TextInput:
           id: input_name
           text: ''

9. Since this field has an id, we can now use the information in this text entry field in our button handler function,
   like:

       self.root.ids.output_label.text = "Hello " + self.root.ids.input_name.text

   You should now be able to type in the text field and click the button to greet by name.  
   Test it and make any changes as needed...   
   and make sure you understand how this works!

10. Lastly, **add a new event handler** for the clear button so that it resets _both_ the text field and the output
    label to blank.

# Intermediate Exercises

![Square Number screenshot](../images/07image3.png)

Open the `squaring.py/kv` files from the demos.

Run the code to see a simple app with a text entry field, a button and a label that squares a number.  
Spend a while reading the code so you know how it works. Pay special attention to the functionality - how it handles the
button being pressed:

# Modifications

![Square Number 2 screenshot](../images/07image4.png)

- Change the output Label text colour to pink (`color` is an RGBA tuple).

- Change the orientation so the widgets display left-to-right instead of top-to-bottom.

- Add a label at the bottom with the text: `Enter a number and press
  "Square"`.

  To do this you will need to use **nested layouts**.  
  There are two 'sections', made with `BoxLayout`, arranged vertically:

    - In the top section (BoxLayout), there are three widgets, arranged horizontally.

    - In the bottom section, there is just one label.

  A good way to think about organising BoxLayouts is to draw boxes to represent them. You can have multiple widgets
  and/or BoxLayouts arranged within a BoxLayout.

- ![BoxLayout sections highlighted screenshot](../images/07image5.png)
  So, in the example image here (Convert Miles to Kilometres), you should notice that the Up and Down buttons are
  vertically arranged within a BoxLayout (the green box).

- This green layout is horizontally arranged next to a TextInput, so these must be inside another BoxLayout (the blue
  box).

- This blue layout (the top third) is vertically arranged along with the "Convert" button and the label below it inside
  yet another BoxLayout (the red box).

- The red BoxLayout will be the top level widget.  
  Nice...

**Refactoring Example:**

Have a look at the following commit "diff" for the squaring program:
<https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals/commit/2f9b38dcfc393e2f50f9b30f6da36f9aabf4ee1f>

You can see that we changed the code so that the button handler function now takes in the value of the text field as a
parameter instead of getting it. This makes the logic less _"tightly coupled"_ to the view.  
It still puts the calculated result back in the view directly, so it's only one step towards better separation, but it
does show you how Git and GitHub can record and show your progress as you improve your code by refactoring.

**But wait... here's an even better example from the same demo!**
The previous version had a line in the kv file, like:
```
on_press: app.handle_calculate(int(input_number.text))
```
This seems fine, but it's doing too much for the "view". We should be able to change out the view for something different and have it still work. Here, the view is doing more than one job...  
 It's converting a type... not it's job.  
So what? Well, what if the user enters text in the field? The kv file contains the code to do the type conversion, which would crash! Where would we put our exception handling? Not in the kv/view!  

So, [this diff shows an update](https://github.com/CP1404/KivyDemos/commit/7b022e48197813e9c73eb8b51edb67a4105d493c) that improves the program by moving the conversion out of the view to where we can handle the possible exception.  
Ah, that's better :) 


# Do-from-scratch Exercises

## Miles to Kilometres Converter

Files: `convert_miles_km.py` and `convert_miles_km.kv`

Create a Python program (.py) and Kivy kv language file (.kv)
to recreate the following layout.  
(The dark grey with white boxes are Buttons, the black with yellow text is a Label and the black on white one is a
TextInput.)

![Convert Miles to Kilometres screenshot](../images/07image6.png)

When you have created the layout, write the functionality for the whole program. As always, do this in small steps.

- Use a `StringProperty` for the text on the output (km) label.  
  Then in the app you can set this property variable without having to manually update the text of the label. It will
  automatically update.  
  See the `mvc_demo.py` and kv file in the demos for an example of this.

- You should be able to type a number in the text entry field.

- Pressing the "Convert" button should calculate the conversion from miles to kilometres and display this in the bottom
  label. (Oops, "m"
  in the screenshot is not a good abbreviation for "miles".)

- Pressing the Up or Down buttons should make this (miles) number go up/down by 1

    - Note: You can handle both of these with the same function by passing a value, e.g.  
      `on_press: handle_increment(-1)`
      Or, you may like to pass the text of the input field when you call this, like:
      `on_press: handle_increment(whatever_your_input_id_is.text, -1)`

### Stage 2

- Handle invalid inputs. If the text entered is not a valid number, just set the output result to 0.0.  
  It should not crash or produce errors in the console.

- Pressing Up/Down when the box is empty or invalid should assume the value is 0 and change it to 1/-1.

- Remove the convert button (comment it out) and make the result appear immediately when either text is entered or the
  up/down buttons are pressed (you can handle this with Kivy's `on_text` event)

- Did you use a `CONSTANT` in your conversion calculation?  
  Do this now if you haven't already.

**Note:** The solution to this is provided (`convert_miles_km.py/kv`).  
Don't just copy it, but do use it if you get stuck, and/or to compare your solution to ours.

## Dynamic Kivy Widgets

All of these programs so far have had the widgets "hard-coded" in the .kv file, but what if we want to create dynamic
widgets based on a variable or the contents of a file or something?

Open `dynamic_widgets.py/kv` to see how this can be done.

The keys to this are:

- Give an `id` to the layout widget that you want to add items to
  (in the .kv file)

    - Note that this cannot be the root widget!

- Create the widgets (e.g. buttons) in Python code, e.g.

      temp_button = Button(text=name)

- Add these new widgets using the `add_widget` method, e.g.

      self.root.ids.entries_box.add_widget(temp_button)

- Bind a function callback when you make the widget object to add event handler code, e.g.

      temp_button.bind(on_release=self.press_entry)

### Dynamic Labels

Files: `dynamic_labels.py` and `dynamic_labels.kv`

Now it's your turn...

Create a **very simple app** that has a list of names (strings) and displays each one as a separate *Label*.

Notice some things in dynamic_widgets demo that will be very similar in yours:

- the dictionary is defined in the `init` function
- the widgets (Buttons, but yours will be Labels) are made with a loop between loading the kv file and returning
  from `build`

**Note:** Start a new blank Python program for this; do not copy the dynamic_widgets example as it is too different.
Your app won't have any buttons or interactivity. Use the example as a reference and copy small sections or ideas from
it.

Here's a suggested kv file you could use. Notice how simple it is, but it does have a child `BoxLayout` with an `id`.

    BoxLayout:
        BoxLayout:
            orientation: 'vertical'
            id: main

# Practice & Extension Work

## Practice

1. Modify your Greeter Program so that the GUI layout looks like:

   ![Greeter Program 2 screenshot](../images/07image7.png)

   Hint: BoxLayouts inside a BoxLayout, and a `size_hint_x`...

2. Create a simple GUI similar to your greeting app that lets a user type in their score out of 100, click a button and
   the app shows
   "Pass" or "Fail" (based on the value) in a label.

    - Then extend this to show the JCU-style grade (e.g. 65-75 is a credit).

3. Make a GUI for the temperature converter program you did in the first practical.  
   It will be very similar to the miles to kilometres program, but instead of just copying that one and modifying it,
   try doing the new one from scratch and only looking at the miles converter to help you if you need it.

4. Make a dynamically generated GUI with a button for each person found in a file. Load the file at the start, that
   contains lines like
   "Name,age" (e.g. "Bill Gates,72"). Display one button for each person with their name on the button. When you push
   the button it should show their age in a label at the bottom.

## Extension

1. Do you have an **Android** device? If so, run one or more of your Kivy apps on it using **Kivy Launcher**, as
   described at:
   <http://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html#packaging-your-application-for-the-kivy-launcher>

   ![Kivy app running on Android tablet with joy](../images/07image8.jpg)

   If your Android device does not have an SD Card installed, then place your Kivy apps within internal storage, in a
   folder called kivy, with a subfolder for your project, and make sure you have a `main.py` and
   `android.txt` (as explained at the link above) in that folder, like this:

   ![Kivy on Android file folder structure](../images/07image9.png)

   Then you'll experience much joy with your (first!) Android app!

   You may also want to look at [python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android)

2. **Customise your views**
   Open, run and inspect Jason's QuickSum Kivy app from (two files, `quick_sum.py/kv`). As explained in the lectures,
   notice the way it uses:
    - class rules like `<Button>`
    - `canvas.before` and `canvas.after` to change the background colour or other aspects of a widget Use these
      techniques to change your miles->kilometres converter to use black text on white background widgets - or something
      else that you'd like visually.  
      Play around as much as you like with this, but don't worry about all the details of getting exactly the style you
      want.

3. **Implement our "GuessingGame" app**
   We started working on a simple guessing game Kivy app here: <https://github.com/CP1404/GuessingGame>
    - Form a team of two students for some **pair programming**
    - Have a look at the repo, and try your hand at making the app work

# Deliverables

This section summarises the expectations for marking in this practical.

- `box_layout_demo.py/kv` with modifications (greet, clear)
- `squaring.py/kv` with modifications
- `convert_miles_km.py/kv`
- `dynamic_labels.py/kv` with Labels (not Buttons)
